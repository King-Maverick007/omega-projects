# omega projects

This is my personal omega project list.

However, feel free to post ideas of your own!

Also please have no reservations about implementing any of these projects.
These projects need to exist and I don't have time for all of them.

[Check out the issues section.](https://github.com/substack/omega-projects/issues)

# funds

If you would like to help support or sponsor these projects with money or
resources, you can give funds with [gratipay](https://gratipay.com/substack) or
send me an email (substack@gmail.com) if you have something else in mind.
